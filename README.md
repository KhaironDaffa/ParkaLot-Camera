# ParkaLot-Camera Documentation
1. Make a main acitvity with an ImageView to preview a chosen image, an image picker button to choose an image that you want, and an upload button to upload image to server.
2. To make those functions, you can see it https://github.com/KhaironDaffa/ParkaLot-Camera/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/dicoding/parkalotcamera
3. You will need internet permission for this so kindly add them in Manifest file and also dont forgot to add implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0', implementation "com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0", and implementation 'com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:5.0.0-alpha.2' because we will use retrofit to POST image to server
